# BIDBAX Developer Assignment

This is a fairly straightforward coding test and an open-ended question. The open-ended question doesn't really have a right or wrong answer- we just want to see how you approach the problem and what type of solution you come up with. Hopefully it's a fun thought experiment. :)

We look forward to seeing your answers.

### How to submit your responses

* Branch out from the `main` branch and give your branch an easy and short name, for example `your-first-name`
* Carefully read the instructions for the [coding test](Assignment_a.md) and the [open-ended question](Assignment_b.md)
* Work with your solutions for the coding assignment and the open-ended question.
* After finishing the tasks, commit your changes into `your-first-name` branch.
* Open a pull request. we will discuss your changes during the technical interview

>**Note** Remember to replace the branch name `your-first-name` with your actual first name :)
